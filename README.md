## Python bindings

The Python bindings are generated using [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

Some operating systems require additional packages to be installed.
```
$ sudo apt install python3-dev
```

[maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin) is recommended for building the Python bindings in this crate.
```
$ pip install maturin
$ maturin build --cargo-extra-args="--features python"
```

Alternatively, refer to the [Building and Distribution section](https://pyo3.rs/v0.8.5/building_and_distribution.html) in the [pyo3 user guide](https://pyo3.rs/v0.8.5/).
Note, you must pass the `--cargo-extra-args="--features python"` argument to Maturin when building this crate
to enable the Python binding features.
