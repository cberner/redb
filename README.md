A simple, portable, high-performance, ACID, embedded key-value store.

redb is written in pure Rust and is loosely inspired by [lmdb](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/). Data is stored in a collection
of copy-on-write B-trees. For more details, see the [design doc](docs/design.md)

```rust
use redb::{Database, Error, ReadableTable, TableDefinition};

const TABLE: TableDefinition<&str, u64> = TableDefinition::new("my_data");

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let db = Database::create("my_db.redb")?;
    let write_txn = db.begin_write()?;
    {
        let mut table = write_txn.open_table(TABLE)?;
        table.insert("my_key", &123)?;
    }
    write_txn.commit()?;

    let read_txn = db.begin_read()?;
    let table = read_txn.open_table(TABLE)?;
    assert_eq!(table.get("my_key")?.unwrap().value(), 123);

    Ok(())
}
```

## Status
redb is undergoing active development, and should be considered beta quality. The file format is stable,
but redb has not been widely deployed in production systems (at least to my knowledge).

## Features
* Zero-copy, thread-safe, `BTreeMap` based API
* Fully ACID-compliant transactions
* MVCC support for concurrent readers & writer, without blocking
* Crash-safe by default
* Savepoints and rollbacks

## Benchmarks
redb has similar performance to other top embedded key-value stores such as lmdb and rocksdb
